# we now have a test dataset in which all RUs completed the diagnostic assessment,
# and 7 (randomly selected) RUs started their first improvement cycle.
# It's not a given that all 7 of these RUs had a complete observation 
# during the diagnostic phase (a complete observation being 
# defined as surveying > 50% of students in a single M-F 
# period), and it's not a given that all 7 of them have > 50% 
# participation for their improvement cycle.

# But the moment a single reporting unit achieves a SECOND complete 
# observation, from that day (week?) forward, all data for all 
# RUs on their team are counted as part of a second wave.
# NOW test this wave rule

# first, just see if I can define observations correctly here.
# A set of student observations is a complete observation IFF
# - At least 50% of students in the reporting unit have been surveyed
# since the start of the wave
# - At least an entire M-F period has passed that includes the first
# survey response in the wave (e.g., if the first student responded
# on Wednesday, then the observation isnâ€™t complete until Friday,
# even if 80% of students have been surveyed)



# define ALL complete observations for each reporting unit
# observations include all M-F responses for a given reporting unit
# observations are complete IFF they include > 50% of expected responses
