# WARNING!!! This script is working, but it is hard to work with. There was a mistake with
# participation codes, so some schools participated in CG18 Qualtrics survey using their 2017 code
# (pure 2017), others with 2018 code (pure 2018), and a third type participated with both codes (mixed group)
# In addtion, the pure 2017 group has two subtypes, one subtype are those who registered for 2018, and another subtype
# are those who did not not register for 2018, and had only their 2017 account. For the second subtype we are not doing
# anything, unless Nash says something different. To handle these issues, the code is interupted at several places
# by chunks which deal with survey_id and project_cohort_id reassignment. The general pattern is that for the cg17 codes
# we replace survey_id and project_cohort_id with the cg18 values for the same organization.
#
#There is additional issue which you might want to solve if running the code again.The metascript creates a ggplot
# object which is then printed in the Rmd. It came out that this is not a graphica object, but just a code, which
# then is executed in the Rmd. This adds about 30s per school, which could be a lot of time. The way to fix this is
# to save the graph as png, and then print it in the Rmd for each call.

### merge in project-cohort info from Triton. Note that we will begin by
### merging the survey table to the Qualtrics table on survey_id. Per the documentation
### here (https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tEZ_mlI11xyo8g9Kr8l7u8uXyZfJqB_mmnWdW52eJv8/edit#slide=id.g11ba45caf1_0_0),
### the survey field is the most precise way to match survey records with other info in the database.
### Note that using another variable, like organization_id, will get you in trouble because orgs
### can have multiple program_ids. Starting by merging in the survey table will never lead you astray.
