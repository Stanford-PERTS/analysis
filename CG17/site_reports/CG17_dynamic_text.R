        <p>
        Students who are confident they belong and are valued by their teachers and
        peers are able to engage more fully in learning. They have fewer behavior
        problems, are more open to critical feedback, take greater advantage of
        learning opportunities, build important relationships, and generally have
        more positive attitudes about their classwork and teachers. In turn, they
        are more likely to persevere in the face of difficulty and do better in school.
        <br><br>
        When students are uncertain about whether they belong, they are vigilant
        for cues in the environment that signal whether or not they belong, fit in,
        or are welcome there. They may also be concerned about confirming a negative
        stereotype about their group. This hyper-vigilance and extra stress uses up
        cognitive resources that are essential for learning, diminishing their
        performance and discouraging them from building valuable relationships with 
        peers and instructors.
