  Thank you for participating in the Social-Belonging for College Students program! This report is provided by PERTS and the College Transition Collaborative to share how your students are thinking about their transition to college, and let you know how many students at [SCHOOL NAME] participated in the program.

  <h1>About the Social-Belonging for College Students Program</h1>

  [SCHOOL NAME] sought to support a sense of belonging for incoming students by enrolling them in the Social-Belonging for College Students program, an online activity designed by researchers at the College Transition Collaborative and made available to schools by PERTS. This program draws on years of psychological research to help buffer students against threats to their sense of belonging in school and support greater academic and social engagement in the face of common challenges. Students read short passages from upper-year students emphasizing how difficulties in the transition to college are normal and can be overcome with time. Students then wrote a brief essay reflecting on what challenges they anticipate or have experienced in the transition to college, and how those challenges are common and likely to improve.

  <h2>What is social-belonging?</h2>
  Almost all students face challenges and setbacks in the transition to college, from making new friends, to receiving a low grade on a test, to building relationships with professors. For students from socially disadvantaged backgrounds (such as racial/ethnic minority students or first generation college students), awareness of negative stereotypes and underrepresentation can affect their interpretation of difficulties and prompt them to wonder if they, or people like them, belong or will be able to succeed in college. When these students encounter common challenges in the critical first weeks and months--like feelings of loneliness or receiving negative feedback--these challenges can seem like proof they don\'t belong or can\'t succeed. This inference in response to early difficulties can lead to social and academic withdrawal which, in turn, leads to lower academic achievement and persistence.

  What can help, then, is information that helps students understand that worries about belonging are normal in the transition to college, do not indicate a lack of belonging, and improve with time. The Social-Belonging Program aims to get students out of a yes/no fixed mindset, in which daily experiences are viewed as evidence for/against their belonging in school, and into a process mindset, where they view belonging as a process that develops over time over which they have some control. When students adopt this process mindset of belonging, they are more likely to remain academically and socially engaged on campus in the face of challenges and setbacks, and ultimately demonstrate greater academic persistence and achievement.

  The Social-Belonging Program does not act independently. Its effectiveness is based on its ability to remove psychological barriers that would have otherwise prevented students from engaging in adaptive behaviors that promote academic achievement and persistence (e.g., attending office hours, joining student groups). All of the programs, mentors, and other supports your school already provides are integral to the success of this program.

  <h1>Highlights of Student Responses</h1>

  In this section we present a summary of what your students shared on a number of survey measures designed to assess their expectations and beliefs about the transition to college. These survey measures were asked after the primary program content, where students read nine passages from upper-year students and wrote their own response reflecting on the challenges they expect to encounter in their transition to college and how those can improve with time. While we are not able to directly assess the impact of the program on student academic outcomes, the descriptive measures shared in this report provide an initial view into how your students are thinking about their transition to college and how their responses to psychological measures relate to the core aims of this program.

  At [SCHOOL NAME], [n_compl_progr] completed the full program, including post-activity survey questions. To understand how students are viewing the transition to college after the primary program activity, we\'ve organized your students\' responses under two key questions:
  <ol>
  <li><b>Do students anticipate their sense of belonging to grow over time?</b> If students are internalizing the core message of the social-belonging activity--that difficulties in the transition to college are normal and improve with time--we would expect most students to anticipate feeling more belonging in their second year compared to their first year. <b>At [SCHOOL NAME], [pct_belonging] of students anticipated their sense of belonging to grow between their first and second years.</b></li>
  <li><b>Do students anticipate difficulties in the transition to college in a positive light, and remain excited to come to college?</b> Because the social-belonging activity prompts students to think about difficulties they may experience in the transition to college, we expect students to realistically anticipate that their transition may be difficult, but also to view these difficulties as a positive challenge and remain highly excited about coming to college. <b>At [SCHOOL NAME], [pct_difficult] of students expected their transition to college to be at least moderately difficult, and [pct_pos_difficulties] of students at least mostly agreed that they viewed difficulties in their upcoming transition as a positive challenge. [pct_excited] were very excited or more about coming to [SCHOOL NAME].</b></li>
  </ol>
  Our research indicates that students from backgrounds socially disadvantaged in higher education--defined in this report as first-generation and continuing-generation Black/African American, Hispanic/Latino, and Native students, and first-generation White students--face the greatest barriers to belonging in college and are most likely to benefit from this program. For each outcome we show summary statistics of student responses for "disadvantaged" students, "advantaged" students, and all students regardless of background. These categories were determined based on student responses to demographic questions at the end of the activity; please note the "all students" category also includes students for whom insufficient demographic data was available.
  <br>
  <h4>Notes about graphs and tables</h4>
  <ul>
  <li>Gray bars in the graphs or empty cells in the tables  indicate that there were fewer than five students for at least one response option within a demographic category. We do not display disaggregated results when this happens so that individual student responses can not be deduced.</li>
  <li>If the demographic categories contain missing values, the overall mean in the bar graphs or tables could differ from the combined means for the separate levels.</li>
  <li>Statistical inferences based on small sample sizes are limited. If a fairly small number of students participated at your school, their responses may not be representative of your student population as whole, particularly in assessing differences between subgroups.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>1: Do students anticipate their sense of belonging to grow over time? </h2>

  The Social-Belonging Program prompts students to think about belonging as a process that can improve with time. Rather than viewing difficult experiences as indications they may not belong in college, students are instead encouraged to view difficulties as normal challenges they are able to overcome. We expect students who see belonging as a process to anticipate feeling more like they belong over the course of college.

  At [SCHOOL NAME], [pct_belonging] of all students anticipated their sense of belonging to grow between their first and second years. We measured this by asking students to rate how much they expect to fit in, belong, and feel at home at [SCHOOL NAME] at two points in time: at the beginning of fall term in their first year, and at the end of their second year. We then calculated each student\'s anticipated growth in belonging by subtracting the average of their first-year belonging expectations from the average of their second-year belonging expectations.

  Below we show the percent of students who anticipated a positive change in belonging, reported for all students, disadvantaged students, and advantaged students. Higher percentages mean more students anticipating their sense of belonging to grow over time, which indicates they are thinking about belonging through a process mindset instead of a fixed mindset.

  <h2>2: Do students anticipate difficulties in the transition to college in a positive light and remain excited to come to college? </h2>

  It is important for students to have realistic expectations of college and anticipate some difficulties in their transition. The Social-Belonging Program prompts students to consider difficulties they may experience, but also frames these difficulties as positive challenges they can overcome. We expect students to realistically anticipate that the transition to college may be difficult, but to view these difficulties positively and remain excited about coming to college.

  At [SCHOOL NAME], [pct_difficult] of students expected their transition to college to be at least moderately difficult, and [pct_pos_difficulties] of students at least mostly agreed that they viewed difficulties in their upcoming transition as a positive challenge. [pct_excited] were very excited or more about coming to [SCHOOL NAME].

  If you would like to see higher participation rates in the future, so that even more students at your school can learn to think about belonging as a process, below are some tips for how to achieve higher participation rates:
  <ul>
  <li>Build buy-in with facilitators by letting them know about the program and coordinating on implementation ahead of time. You can find a brief, sharable brochure in the Sample Documents section of your Program Information Packet.</li>
  <li>Coordinate with your school\'s new student orientation office to present the program as a key part of new student orientation.</li>
  <li>Promote the program through as many channels as reasonable, including email invitations, embedding a program link in new student checklists, embedding a program link in learning management systems like Blackboard or Google Classroom, and any other creative invitation methods that make sense for your school.</li>
  <li>Send regular reminders to students who have not yet participated while the program is open to students.</li>
  </ul>

  <h1>What\'s Next?</h1>

  When students see challenges as normal difficulties that can be overcome, they are more likely to stay engaged in school, especially during challenges and setbacks. The Social-Belonging Program can thus increase students\' reports of the extent to which they email professors, attend office hours, meet with study groups, access other supportive services (e.g. advisors, tutors), participate in class, and study. It can make students more likely to live on campus, and more willing to take on academic challenges that pose a risk of failure but will promote learning (<a href="http://gregorywalton-stanford.weebly.com/uploads/4/9/4/4/49448111/walton_&_cohen-a_question_of_belonging.pdf">Walton & Cohen, 2007</a>; <a href="http://gregorywalton-stanford.weebly.com/uploads/4/9/4/4/49448111/yeagerwaltonbradyetal2016.pdf">Yeager, Walton et al., 2016</a>). In turn, these changes in behavior help students develop close friendships on campus, get more involved in student groups, and develop mentor relationships, which can contribute to lasting improvements in achievement (<a href="http://gregorywalton-stanford.weebly.com/uploads/4/9/4/4/49448111/waltonlogelpeachspencerzanna_2015.pdf">Walton, Logel et al., 2015</a>; <a href="http://gregorywalton-stanford.weebly.com/uploads/4/9/4/4/49448111/yeagerwaltonbradyetal2016.pdf">Yeager, Walton et al., 2016</a>). In previous implementations, the Social-Belonging Program has led to increases in retention and GPA, as well as greater social and academic integration among racial/ethnic minority students and first-generation college students.

  The impact of the Social-Belonging Program is closely tied to each school\'s campus climate, institutional messaging, and available resources and supports for students. Effects can vary across settings and emerge over time. We encourage you to use the information in this report as a starting point to help understand your students\' psychological experience of the transition to college. We also invite you to visit PERTS\'s <a href="https://www.mindsetkit.org/">Mindset Kit</a> for resources that can help foster adaptive mindsets, and follow the College Transition Collaborative\'s work by <a href="http://collegetransitioncollaborative.org/#contact">signing up for our newsletter</a> to receive updates on our research, available resources, and partnership opportunities.

  Do you have tips on what did or didn\'t work for implementing the program at your school? We\'d love to hear from you! Please send an email to support@perts.net if you\'d like to share more about your school\'s experience with the program.

  <h2>About PERTS</h2>

  PERTS is an organization that empowers educators to improve student outcomes by applying research-based practices. Education research has a serious problem when it comes to translating ideas into practices. Concepts that are often untested at scale become fads that educators are required to implement in their classrooms without proper training, and students end up suffering the consequences. Promising research is left in the dust when the "Next Big Thing" comes along and policy makers repeat the cycle.

  Our mission at PERTS is to improve the equity of learning outcomes by bridging the gap between cutting-edge research and implementation practices. We believe that properly scaling educational research can empower schools to reduce inequity and create better experiences for students and teachers.

  <h2>About the College Transition Collaborative</h2>

  The mission of the College Transition Collaborative (CTC) is to create higher education learning environments that foster equitable student outcomes by bridging research and practice. Our work helps schools better understand how their students experience moments of transition or difficulty, and how psychologically attuned practices--messages, policies, behaviors, and programs--can convey to all students they are valued, respected, and can excel. CTC\'s work has helped support greater engagement, achievement, and completion for students at diverse colleges and universities across the United States.

  Below we show summary statistics for each outcome by student self-reported demographics; please note that demographic categories for which any group had fewer than five students are not shown to preserve student privacy. In interpreting these results, please keep in mind that inferences based on small samples are unreliable and may not represent all students belonging to that demographic group at your school. Please note that this information must not be used to evaluate or target individual students or specific demographic groups; rather, we encourage you to use this data to identify ways that your institution can support your students even more as a whole.'
